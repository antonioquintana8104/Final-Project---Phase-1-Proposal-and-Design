# Final-Project---Phase-1-Proposal-and-Design
Final project Basic programming 1
This program is a Culture Library that prioritizes culturally rich recommendations across different types of media. It is designed for a general audience, but especially for young users, as cultural media has recently been losing visibility due to algorithms that prioritize engagement over cultural value. The program provides recommendations for songs, books, and even movies! Users can also rate the recommendations, allowing the library to improve over time. The python prgramm uses three different libraries: random, os, and pandas, to use them you will need to install pandas usinng the following command on terminal. For windows: "py -m pip install pandas openpyxl", and for MacOS: "python3 -m pip install pandas openpyxl". The programm uses the data from the file "database.xlsx", this file must be downloaded beforehand and placed in the same folder as the program for it to work. It contains all the media information, including name, type of media (song/book/movie), genre, description, cultural information, and user ratings. This version of the Culture Library demonstrates how users can already benefit from curated cultural recommendations, even with a small dataset. It also shows how interactive filtering, genre selection, and rating systems can help promote meaningful cultural content.
