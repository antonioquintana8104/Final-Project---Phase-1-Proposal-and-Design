Final project Basic computing 1
This program is a Library that prioritizes culturally rich recommendations. This Culture library is aimed to the general public but specially ofr a young audience as cultural media has lately been loosing relevance due to algorithms that prioritize engagement of the general public. This program uses the pandas and random libraries of which pandas will need to be downladed beforehand in order for the program to work. This program uses the data from the "database.xlsx", this file should also be downloaded before hand in order for the program to work. In this early version of our program we can see how people can already benefit from culturally rich recommendations even from this rough version and few possible recommendations.
